                Arcane was originally implemented with Intermediate GUI, which meant that it was still a GUI
                application, but it was from a different design and purpose. It wasn't a very successful implementation
                because the idea wasn't meant to be designed with Intermediate GUI at the start, and trying to wrapping
                OOP based approach in a FP style was very painful. I have given up trying to refactor that project, so I
                made this to recreate Arcane from scratch.

                    the original game and there are some items which are custom made!

                This was what Arcane looked like when it was made with ImGUI (Intermediate GUI framework). Although it
                looked pretty on the outside, it was super painful to add features to internally and it just felt like a
                mess.
