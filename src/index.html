                Arcane was originally implemented with Intermediate GUI, which meant that it was still a GUI
                application, but it was from a different design and purpose. It wasn't a very successful implementation
                because the idea wasn't meant to be designed with Intermediate GUI at the start, and trying to wrapping
                OOP based approach in a FP style was very painful. I have given up trying to refactor that project, so I
                made this to recreate Arcane from scratch.
